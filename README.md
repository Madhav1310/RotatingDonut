# RotatingDonut

<br>

RotatingDonut is a Python adaptation of the iconic [C-based ASCII donut](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html). Originally crafted in C to demonstrate the principles of 3D projection and rotation with a minimalistic approach, this Python version replicates that magic, making it more accessible and easier to comprehend :)

Inspired by the simplicity of the original donut.c program, I ventured further into the realm of 3D ASCII art with my own creation â€” CubeRot.py. This script brings a spinning colored 3D cube to life, demonstrating how Python can be used for educational and visually engaging programming exercises.
