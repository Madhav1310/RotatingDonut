# RotatingDonut

RotatingDonut is a Python adaptation of the classic C-based ASCII donut. Originally written in C to demonstrate 3D projection and rotation with minimal code, this version translates the magic into Python, making it more accessible and easy to understand :)

Encouraged by the simplicity yet effectiveness of donut.c, I included CubeRot.py, which is my own take on 3D ASCII art!
